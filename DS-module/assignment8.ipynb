    "     |                   |----(SQL)------>|                |\n",
    "     |                   |                |                |\n",
    "     |                   |<----(Data)-----|                |\n",
    "     |                   |                |                |\n",
    "     |                   |                |----(APIs)------>|\n",
    "     |                   |                |                |\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. User Interface:\n",
    "The user interface is responsible for presenting the website to the users and allowing them to interact with it. It includes\n",
    "features like product search, product listing, product details, shopping cart, checkout, user registration, login, and\n",
    "customer support. The user interface should be designed with a responsive layout to ensure compatibility with different \n",
    "devices and screen sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Product Management:\n",
    "The product management component allows administrators to manage the products available on the website. It includes \n",
    "functionalities like adding new products, updating existing product details, and removing products from the system. The \n",
    "product information is stored in the database and can include attributes such as name, description, price, images, and \n",
    "categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Order Management:\n",
    "The order management component handles the process of placing and managing orders. Users can add items to their shopping \n",
    "carts, modify quantities, and proceed to checkout. After placing an order, users receive an order confirmation email. Admins\n",
    "can view and process orders, update order statuses, generate invoices, and handle returns or refunds.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. User Management:\n",
    "The user management component handles user registration, login, and authentication. It allows users to create accounts, log \n",
    "in to their accounts, and perform actions specific to their roles, such as customers or administrators. Registered users can\n",
    "view their order history, manage addresses, and save payment methods securely.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Payment Gateway Integration:\n",
    "The payment gateway integration component enables secure online transactions. It integrates with a reliable payment gateway\n",
    "service, such as Stripe or PayPal, to handle payment verification, authorization, and order completion. Users can choose \n",
    "from various payment methods, including credit cards, debit cards, and online wallets.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Security and Privacy:\n",
    "The security and privacy component ensures the protection of user data and prevents unauthorized access. It implements \n",
    "measures like encryption for sensitive information like passwords and payment details. The website should comply with industry\n",
    "standards and regulations, such as GDPR, to safeguard user privacy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Low-Level Design (LLD) for the E-commerce Website:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Front-End Design:\n",
    "The front-end design involves creating the user interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It focuses on providing an \n",
    "intuitive and visually appealing experience for users. The front-end consists of modular components such as product listing, \n",
    "search, cart, checkout, and user authentication. The following flowchart illustrates the typical user flow through the front\n",
    "-end:\n",
    "    \n",
    "=> Product page:This component displays the details of a single product,including the product name,description,price,and images.\n",
    "=> Category page: This component displays a list of products in a particular category.\n",
    "=> Search page: This component allows users to search for products by keyword.\n",
    "=> Cart page: This component allows users to add products to their cart and checkout.\n",

    "         +---------------------------------+\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Back-End Architecture:\n",
    "The back-end architecture involves using a server-side programming language (e.g., Python, Ruby, or Node.js) and a web\n",
    "framework (e.g., Django, Ruby on Rails, or Express.js). The server-side code handles requests from the front-end, processes \n",
    "business logic, and communicates with the database. The following diagram illustrates the flow of data and interactions in the\n",
    "back-end:\n",
    "    \n",
    "=> Product service: This service provides access to the product data.\n",
    "=> Order service: This service processes orders and manages user accounts.\n",
    "=> Payment service: This service handles payments.\n",
    "=> API gateway: This component exposes the API to other applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "                    +------------------+\n",
    "                    |                  |\n",
    "                    |   Web Server     |\n",
    "                    |                  |\n",
    "                    +---+-----+--------+\n",
    "                        |     |\n",
    "              +---------v-----v--------+\n",
    "              |                      |\n",
    "              |   Application Server  |\n",
    "              |                      |\n",
    "              +---------+-----+------+\n",
    "                        |     |\n",

    "          |   Database                       |\n",
    "          |                                  |\n",
    "          +----------------------------------+\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Database Design:\n",
    "The database design involves creating an appropriate database schema to store and manage data. A relational database\n",
    "management system (RDBMS) like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or Oracle can be used. The database schema should include tables for\n",
    "products, orders, users, and other relevant entities. Relationships and indexes should be defined to ensure efficient data\n",
    "retrieval and management.\n",
    "\n",
    "=> Products: This table stores the product information.\n",
    "=> Categories: This table stores the category information.\n",
    "=> Orders: This table stores the order information.\n",
    "=> Users: This table stores the user information.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Caching:\n",
    "Implementing caching mechanisms can enhance website performance. Caching frequently accessed data such as product listings,\n",
    "user sessions, and static content reduces the load on the database and improves response times. Tools like Redis or Memcached \n",
    "can be used for caching.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Third-Party Integrations:\n",
    "The website integrates with third-party services to enhance its functionalities. For example, integration with a payment \n",
    "gateway API (e.g., Stripe or PayPal) enables secure online transactions. Integration with shipping APIs can provide real-time\n",
    "shipping quotes and order tracking information.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Security Measures:\n",
    "To ensure security, implement measures such as input validation, authentication, and authorization mechanisms. Protect \n",
    "sensitive information like passwords and payment details using hashing and salting techniques. Apply HTTPS encryption to \n",
    "secure communication between the server and clients.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Scalability and Performance:\n",
    "Design the system to handle high traffic and ensure scalability. Utilize load balancing techniques, such as horizontal scaling\n",
    ", to distribute the load across multiple servers. Employ caching, content delivery networks (CDNs), and database optimization \n",
    "techniques to enhance performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Error Handling and Logging:\n",
    "Implement proper error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle exceptions and display informative error messages to users.\n",
    "Use logging frameworks to record system events and errors for debugging and auditing purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. The API should be implemented using a RESTful API. This will make it easy for other applications to interact with the e-\n",
    "   commerce website. The API should expose the following endpoints:\n",
    "\n",
    "/products: This endpoint returns a list of products.\n",
    "/products/:id: This endpoint returns the details of a single product.\n",
    "/categories: This endpoint returns a list of categories.\n",
    "/orders: This endpoint returns a list of orders.\n",
    "/users: This endpoint returns a list of users."
